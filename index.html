            <h1>DNSCrypt</h1>

            <p>DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents
                DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver
                and haven't been tampered with.
            </p>

            <p>It is an open specification, with free and opensource reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with
                any company nor organization.</p>

            <h2>Free, DNSCrypt-enabled resolvers are available all over the world</h2>

            <p>
                A couple companies, organizations and individuals are operating <a href="https://dnscrypt.org/dnscrypt-resolvers.html"

                all you need to run is a client.
            </p>

            <p>
                A constantly updated <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/blob/master/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv">list of open DNSCrypt resolvers</a>                can be downloaded to replace the default CSV file shipped with the <a href="#dnscrypt-proxy">dnscrypt-proxy</a>                client.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are running your own public DNS resolver in order to help make the Internet a more secure place, please submit a
                <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/pulls">pull request</a> to have your resolver added to

            <p>
                DNSCrypt itself is not a product, but a protocol that anyone can implement. Portable implementations are also available,
                on top on which graphical user interfaces and convenient tools have been built.
            </p>

            <p>
                Choose your platform to discover some of the available options: <a href="#dnscrypt-windows">Windows</a> -
                <a href="#dnscrypt-macos">macOS</a> - <a href="#dnscrypt-proxy">Linux / BSD</a> - <a href="#dnscrypt-android">Android</a>                - <a href="#dnscrypt-ios">iOS</a> or run the software on a <a href="#dnscrypt-routers">router</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Firewall setup: although some resolvers may prefer a different port, the default port used by the DNSCrypt protocol is 443.
                Outgoing queries to this port on both TCP and UDP should be allowed by your firewall.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Running DNSCrypt on Android currently requires a rooted device. If you don't know how to root an Android device, the
                    <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xda-developers</a> forum is
                    a good place to start.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start by downloading a precompiled <a href="https://download.dnscrypt.org/dnscrypt-proxy/" target="_blank"
                            rel="noopener">dnscrypt-proxy package for Android</a>.</li>
                    <li>If you want to change the DNSCrypt resolver to use, unzip the archive, edit the <code>RESOLVER_NAME</code>                        variable in <code>system/etc/init.d/99dnscrypt</code>. Keep the content as a ZIP file, with the original
                        structure.
                    </li>
                    <li>Upload the ZIP file to the device, into <code>/sdcard</code> or any location you can write to.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that you have a custom recovery such as TWRP or CWM. The easiest way is to download and install
                        <strong>TWRP Manager</strong> from the Google Play Store. Reboot in recovery mode and install the
                        ZIP file.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reboot.</li>
                    <li>Dowload and install <strong>Universal Init.d</strong> from the Google Play Store. Follow the instructions
                        until you see <code>Your Kernel Has init.d Support</code>.</li>
                    <li>The DNSCrypt proxy should be running at this point, but your device may still use the previous DNS settings.
                        Download and install <strong>DNS Changer</strong> fron the Google Play Store. In order to actually
                        use DNSCrypt, enter <code>127.0.0.1</code> as the primary DNS resolver. In order to stop using DNSCrypt,
                        leave this field empty.
                    </li>
                    <li>DNS changes may not be visible immediately. Android has its own DNS cache, and web browsers such as Chrome
                        have another layer of DNS caching. In order to clear Chrome's DNS cache, enter <code>chrome://net-internals/#dns</code>                        in the URL bar, and press <strong>Clear host cache</strong>.

                <h2>Running your own DNSCrypt server</h2>

                <p>If you are running your own private or public recursive DNS server, adding support for the DNSCrypt protocol
                    can be done by installing <a href="https://github.com/Cofyc/dnscrypt-wrapper">DNSCrypt-Wrapper</a>, the
                    reference server-side DNSCrypt proxy.
                </p>

                <p>DNSCrypt-Wrapper can be compiled from the source code. OSX users can also use Homebrew to install it:
                    <code>brew install dnscrypt-wrapper</code>.
                </p>

                <p>The proxy is compatible with any DNS resolver software, including Unbound, PowerDNS Recursor and BIND.</p>

                <p>A <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-server-docker">Docker image for dnscrypt server</a> is also
                    available, and is the easiest and fastest way to deploy a DNSSEC-validating, DNSCrypt-enabled caching
                    DNS server. It includes a pre-configured Unbound server, dnscrypt-wrapper, and all the scripts required
                    to perform key rotation and supervision.</p>

                <p>Another option is <a href="http://dnsdist.org/">dnsdist</a>, a highly DNS-, DoS- and abuse-aware loadbalancer.
                    Its goal in life is to route traffic to the best server, delivering top performance to legitimate users
                    while shunting or blocking abusive traffic.</p>

                <p>dnsdist <a href="https://github.com/PowerDNS/pdns/blob/master/pdns/README-dnsdist.md#dnscrypt">can act as a DNSCrypt server</a>                    when compiled with <code>--enable-dnscrypt</code>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.unbound.net/">unbound</a>, a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver, can also act
                    as a DNSCrypt server when compiled with <code>--enable-dnscrypt</code>.</p>

            <h2>Deployment</h2>

            <p>
                DNSCrypt is typically deployed using a pair of DNS proxies: a client proxy and a server proxy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The client side of DNSCrypt is a proxy to which regular DNS clients can connect to. Instead of using your ISP's DNS settings,
                you can just configure your network settings to use <code>127.0.0.1</code> or whatever IP
                address and port you configured the DNSCrypt client to listen to. The client proxy translates regular DNS
                queries into authenticated DNS queries, forwards them to a server running the server DNSCrypt proxy, verifies
                the responses, and forwards them to the client if they appear to be genuine.
            </p>

            <p>
                The server side of DNSCrypt receives DNS queries sent by the client proxy, forwards them to a trusted DNS resolver, and signs
                the responses it receives before forwarding them to the client proxy.
            </p>

            <p>
                The DNSCrypt protocol uses UDP and TCP ports 443, which are less likely to be filtered by routers and ISPs than the standard
                DNS port.
            </p>

            <p>
                The local network is usually the most vulnerable network segment against active attacks such as DNS spoofing. The DNSCrypt
                server can run on the router, along with a modern DNS resolver. Clients can then run the client code of DNSCrypt,
                leveraging the router DNS resolver.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, companies, organizations and individuals are running public DNS resolvers supporting the DNSCrypt protocol.
                These can be used as an alternative to running a DNSCrypt server and a DNS resolver on the router.
            </p>

            <p>
                For maximum protection, DNSCrypt client can run on every client device:

</pre>

            <p>
                Or if you totally trust the local network, the DNSCrypt client can run on the router instead:

</pre>

            <p>
                Finally, you can run your own DNSCrypt server on a remote, trusted network, to get full control over what the resolver is
                doing and logging:

Laptop/workstation/phone/tablet --------> home router --------> ISP ----------> the Internet --------> private DNS resolver

    |----------------------------------- Secured by DNSCrypt -------------------------------------------|
                                                                              |--- Secured by DNSSEC ---|
</pre>

            <p>Please note that DNSCrypt is not a replacement for a VPN, as it only authenticates DNS traffic, and doesn't prevent
                third-party DNS resolvers from logging your activity. By design, the TLS protocol, as used in HTTPS and HTTP/2,
                leaks websites host names in plain text, so DNSCrypt is not enough to hide this information.</p>

            <h2>Using DNSCrypt in combination with a DNS cache</h2>

            <p>
                For optimal performance, the recommended way of running DNSCrypt is to run it as a forwarder for a local DNS cache, such
                as Unbound or PowerDNS-Recursor.
            </p>
            <p>
                A caching resolver can provide high availability, by forwarding queries to multiple upstream DNSCrypt client proxies, configured
                with different providers.
            </p>
            <p>
                dnscrypt-proxy instances and the caching resolver can safely run on the same machine as long as they are listening to different
                IP addresses or different ports.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your DNS cache is Unbound, all you need is to edit the unbound.conf file and add the following lines at the end of the
                server section:
            </p>
            <pre>
do-not-query-localhost: no

forward-zone:
  name: "."
  forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@40
  forward-addr: 127.0.0.1@41
</pre>
            <p>
                The first line is not required if you are using different IP addresses instead of different ports. The <code>forward-addr</code>                lines indicate addresses and ports of dnscrypt clients to use as upstream resolvers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, start the two client proxies, listening to different local ports (40 and 41 in this example).
            </p>
            <p>
                Pay attention to the fact that some resolvers do not support the DNS security extensions (DNSSEC).
            </p>
            <p>
                If Unbound is configured to perform DNSSEC validation in combination with an upstream server that does not support DNSSEC,
                queries will fail. Either use only DNSCrypt resolvers with support for DNSSEC, or disable DNSSEC support
                in Unbound by commenting out the <code>auto-trust-anchor-file</code> line in its configuration.
            </p>
            <p>
                A local caching resolver can also be extremely useful to forward queries for CDNs or internal domains to a specific resolver.
